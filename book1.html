            <h3>Prologue</h3>
            <p>
                It was a rainy sky of June, but there was no charm or romance to the
                downpour. Instead, the rain fell relentlessly, as if the heavens were shedding
                tears in sync with my own sorrow. The world had become a grey canvas, devoid
                of the joy and vibrancy that should have accompanied the arrival of June.
            </p>
            <p>
                The raindrops fell onto my face as I was lying on the ground. I couldn’t move
                an inch towards her. I couldn’t help but watch her covered with blood, eyes wide
                opened, shattered glass around her, reflecting her face with tears and blood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Time seemed to stand still as I lay there, the sound of the rain mingling with
                the thumping of my heart. Her face haunted me, etched in agony and despair,
                and my breath caught in my throat. “No, no, this can’t be happening,” I
                whispered, the words lost in the pelting rain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every raindrop that touched my skin felt like a cruel reminder of my
                helplessness. I tried to reach out to her, but my body wouldn’t respond. The pain
                was numbing, both physical and emotional, and I felt as shattered as the glass
                around us.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scene was like a living nightmare, frozen in time. I could see the faint
                outline of people rushing towards us, their voices a distant murmur. Panic and
                fear were etched on their faces, yet it all felt so far away as if I was trapped in a
                bubble of sorrow, disconnected from the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her eyes, once so full of life and love, now held a vacant stare. I desperately
                wanted to wipe away the tears and blood from her face, to hold her close. But I
                couldn’t move, couldn’t even reach out to touch her.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the rain intensified, it mingled with my own tears, blurring the world
                around me even further. It felt as though the rain was weeping for her too,
                mourning the life that had been shattered in an instant.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to scream, to release the overwhelming emotions within me, but my
                voice remained trapped in my throat. All I could do was lie there, watching her,
                feeling the rain and her pain soak into my skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gods, I pray to you, each and every one of you. If you’re there, please let us
                restart again. I have never once asked you for any favour. But I’m asking now,
                just this one time. Please. I’m begging you. “Please, let us restart again,” I
                muttered.
            </p>

            <h3>Chapter 1: A Chapter of Ups and Downs</h3>
            <p>After graduating college, I dove headfirst into the job market, eager to land my first programming job. I sent out countless resumes, went through multiple interviews, and faced rejection after rejection. Each "no" chipped away at my confidence, and as the weeks stretched into months, I began to question whether I was truly cut out for the field.</p>
            <p>Then, unexpectedly, I got an email inviting me to interview for a junior developer role at a small, relatively unknown company. It wasn’t a flashy opportunity, but I figured it was a step in the right direction, so I went for it.</p>
            <p>During the interview, I talked about the projects I've done and why I loved programming. The interviewers seemed interested, which gave me a glimmer of hope. But then came the dreaded technical challenge—a problem unlike anything I’d encountered before. My palms were sweaty as I worked through it. I didn’t solve it perfectly, but I managed to present a workable solution. The interviewers were encouraging, but as I walked out, I wasn’t sure how I’d done. Still, for the first time in a while, I felt a flicker of optimism.</p>
            <p>A few days later, the email arrived: they were offering me the junior developer position. It wasn’t the dream job I’d imagined, but it was a solid starting point—and a turning point in my career.</p>
            <p>On my first day, as I sat down at my desk, I was greeted by a warm smile from my desk neighbor.</p>
            <p>“You must be the new guy—Andrew Campbell, right? Nice to meet you. I’m Benjamin Cooper.”</p>
            <p>“Yes, senior. Nice to meet you.”</p>
            <p>“Please, just call me Ben,” he said with a laugh. “We’re desk neighbors, not senior and junior. Let’s be friends.”</p>
            <p>Ben’s energy was infectious. He introduced me to the team and quickly became a mentor and friend. His enthusiasm for programming and life in general was exactly what I needed after the struggles I’d faced. Beyond helping me grow as a developer, Ben took the time to know me as a person, offering encouragement and advice whenever I felt overwhelmed.</p>
            <p>Later, I got assigned to a project with Mia Robinson, one of the senior developers. At first, I was intimidated, but I soon realized Mia was approachable and warm. With her sharp hazel eyes and neatly tied dark brown hair, she had a calm yet commanding presence. Her simple, elegant style reflected her practical yet confident personality.</p>
            <p>Mia wasn’t just skilled—she was kind, always willing to guide me without making me feel out of place. I quickly came to admire her balance of professionalism and approachability.</p>
            <p>One evening, after a long day at work, my coworker Daniel popped by.</p>
            <p>“Hey, Campbell, we’re heading out for drinks. Want to come?”</p>
            <p>“I’d love to, but I’ve got a ton of work to finish,” I replied.</p>
            <p>“Come on, when your senior invites you, you can’t say no.”</p>
            <p>Hannah, my fellow newbie, chimed in. “Take a break—it might spark some ideas. Plus, I’m free tonight. I can help you catch up later if you need.”</p>
            <p>“I appreciate it, but—”</p>
            <p>“Just come already!” Hannah insisted, grinning.</p>
            <p>“Alright, alright. You win. I’ll come.”</p>
            <p>As we were heading out, Ben called out to Mia. “Hey, Mia, you joining us?”</p>
            <p>“Can’t, I’ve got a date tonight,” she replied.</p>
            <p>“Skipping out on us now that you’ve got a fiancé, huh?”</p>
            <p>“Don’t make me the bad guy here!” Mia laughed.</p>
            <p>“Yeah, yeah. Whatever you say. See you tomorrow!” Ben waved as we left.</p>
            <p>That night, as we all laughed and shared stories, I realized how much I had grown to appreciate my new team. It wasn’t just a job anymore—it was a place where I belonged.</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>After wrapping up my work for the day, I headed back to my apartment. It had been a long day, but the thought of my upcoming date night with my fiancé kept my spirits high. As I walked into his place, a smile crept onto my face, imagining the romantic evening we’d share.</p>
            <p>But the moment I stepped into the living room, my world shattered. Standing there, I saw him—my fiancé—locked in a kiss with a half-dressed woman I’d never seen before. It felt like the air was sucked out of the room. My heart thundered in my chest, and everything around me blurred as if I’d stumbled into a nightmare I couldn’t wake from.</p>
            <p>“Wait, let me explain! It’s not what it looks like,” he stammered, panic dripping from his voice.</p>
            <p>But I couldn’t bring myself to hear him out. The image before me said more than words ever could. My chest felt tight, my heart breaking under the weight of betrayal.</p>
            <p>Without saying a word, I turned and ran, tears streaming down my face. Anger, pain, and disbelief surged through me as I tried to make sense of what I had just seen. Staying in that space—with him and the remnants of our broken trust—was impossible.</p>
            <p>For days after, I retreated into myself, barely able to function. I locked myself away from the world, seeking refuge in the quiet solitude of my apartment. The thought of facing anyone—of seeing their pity or judgment—was unbearable.</p>
            <p>The pain was raw and unrelenting, like a wound that refused to heal. I felt exposed, vulnerable, and utterly alone. The walls I built around myself were the only thing keeping me from collapsing completely.</p>
            <hr class="chapter-end">
            <h3>Chapter 2: Echo of Changes</h3>
            <p>“Hey, Andrew, have you heard from Mia lately?” Ben asked me one afternoon.</p>
            <p>“No, why?” I replied.</p>
            <p>“She hasn’t come to work in weeks. It’s not like her. Even when she’s sick, we have to force her to take a day off.”</p>
            <p>I shook my head. “No, I haven’t. Why are you asking me? You and the other seniors are closer to her than I am.”</p>
            <p>“Well, you two are on the same project, so…”</p>
            <p>“Yeah, and because she hasn’t shown up, I’ve been stuck doing all the work alone,” I snapped. “I don’t even have her number to call her.”</p>
            <p>Ben hesitated before saying, “You should check on her.”</p>
            <p>“Huh? How am I supposed to do that? I don’t even know where she lives.”</p>
            <p>“I can give you her address.”</p>
            <p>“Why don’t <i>you</i> go?”</p>
            <p>“I can’t,” he muttered, looking uncomfortable.</p>
            <p>I raised an eyebrow. “Why not?”</p>
            <p>“There’s... a thing between her fiancé and me. We had a falling out. It’s complicated, and I can’t just show up at her place.”</p>
            <p>“What about the other seniors? Why ask me? I’m drowning in work, remember?”</p>
            <p>“That’s why I’m asking <i>you</i>. If you don’t want to keep doing her work, go and find her.”</p>
            <p>I sighed, frustrated. “Fine.”</p>
            <p>Later, I found myself standing in front of Mia’s apartment, Unit 104. I pressed the doorbell and waited, but there was no response. Impatient, I knocked repeatedly until the door finally creaked open.</p>
            <p>Mia stood there, but she was barely recognizable. She looked frail, as if the weight of the world had pressed down on her. Her face was pale, her eyes puffy and red, her hair unkempt. Her usual polished appearance was gone, replaced by disheveled clothes and an aura of exhaustion and despair.</p>
            <p>I was stunned. The vibrant, cheerful senior I knew was a shadow of herself.</p>
            <p>“Oh, Andrew. Come in,” she said, her voice soft and hoarse.</p>
            <p>I stepped inside, the chaos of her apartment reflecting the turmoil she seemed to be going through. “Sorry about the mess. Can I help you with something?” she asked, forcing a weak smile.</p>
            <p>“…” I had nothing to say.</p>
            <p>“I guess you’re mad at me for not coming to work and leaving you to handle the project alone,” she added, her voice trembling.</p>
            <p>“Senior,” I finally said, “you don’t need to hide it.”</p>
            <p>At those words, the dam broke. Tears poured down her face as her body trembled. She collapsed, and I caught her before she hit the floor. My heart pounded as I carried her to the bed and gently laid her down.</p>
            <p>Once she was resting, I looked around at the cluttered room. Without thinking, I began tidying up, putting things back in order while keeping an eye on her. The mess spoke of weeks of neglect, and as I cleaned, I couldn’t help but wonder what had caused this downward spiral.</p>
            <p>Her usual brightness was gone, replaced by a haunting sadness. I thought of countless possibilities but couldn’t fathom what had broken her so completely.</p>
            <p>After about an hour, she stirred, her eyes fluttering open.</p>
            <p>“You’re awake. How are you feeling?” I asked gently.</p>
            <p>“I... I don’t know. Everything’s a blur,” she mumbled.</p>
            <p>“…”</p>
            <p>“Sorry for dragging you into this mess,” she said weakly. “What a wreck I’ve become. You didn’t have to stay.”</p>
            <p>“I know,” I replied. “And honestly, I wanted to leave. But something kept telling me not to.”</p>
            <p>She looked at me with tear-filled eyes and whispered, “Thank you.”</p>
            <p>I reached out and took her hand. “Senior, I know we’re just colleagues, but you can talk to me. Whatever it is, I’m here. You don’t have to tell me now, but just know you’re not alone.”</p>
            <p>The room grew quiet, the air heavy with unspoken words.</p>
            <p>Finally, I stood up. “Now that you’re awake, I should go. Have a good night, Senior.”</p>
            <p>As I turned to leave, I felt a gentle tug on my hand.</p>
            <p>“Can you... stay a little longer?” she murmured.</p>
            <p>I nodded and sat back down, watching over her as she drifted off to sleep again. Her tear-streaked face looked so vulnerable, and I couldn’t shake the feeling that this moment would mark a change—for both of us.</p>
            <hr class="pov-changed">
            <p>I let out a tired yawn, unable to stifle it as the morning dragged on. Hannah’s voice cut through the air, “Campbell’s yawning!”</p>
            <p>“What? What’s wrong with yawning?” I asked, a bit puzzled by her sudden reaction.</p>
            <p>“Nothing, it’s just not like you. What happened last night? Why are you so sleepy today?” she teased, a sly grin spreading across her face.</p>
            <p>I hesitated for a moment, keeping my eyes fixed on the computer screen.</p>
            <p>Ben chimed in, smirking as he leaned back in his chair. “Yeah, something must’ve gone down last night. Spill it!”</p>
            <p>Before I could respond, Ben’s tone shifted to one of genuine concern. “So, did you go see Mia? Is she okay? Did you convince her to come back to work?”</p>
            <p>“No, I didn’t. I didn’t want to bother her. I can handle the project myself—it’s not that bad,” I lied smoothly, avoiding his gaze.</p>
            <p>But the truth haunted me. Images of Mia’s tear-streaked face flashed in my mind, and I couldn’t bring myself to share what had really happened.</p>
            <p>“Be honest. You went on a date last night, didn’t you? That’s why you didn’t go to Mia’s place,” Ben teased, grinning mischievously.</p>
            <p>“What? No, it’s not that!” I shot back, trying to play it off with a nervous laugh.</p>
            <p>Just then, the office went silent as Mia walked in. She wore a long coat that looked out of place in the warm weather, and her teary eyes were hidden behind oversized sunglasses. Her presence was almost eerie, and I could feel everyone’s eyes on her, their curiosity palpable.</p>
            <p>I was the only one who knew why she seemed so distant, and I felt a pang of guilt. I stood and walked over to her, lowering my voice as I whispered, “Senior, you didn’t have to come in today. I can handle the project.”</p>
            <p>She shook her head softly, her voice barely above a whisper. “No, I need to be here. I need to work... I need a distraction.”</p>
            <p>She took a deep breath, then addressed the office. “I want to apologize for my absence these past weeks. I know I’ve caused extra work for some of you, and I’m sorry.”</p>
            <p>The room was heavy with silence, all eyes on her as she continued. “I’ve been going through a difficult personal situation, and I didn’t handle it well. I should have communicated better. For that, I truly apologize.”</p>
            <p>Her voice wavered, and I could sense how hard it was for her to admit this in front of everyone. The sincerity in her words softened the atmosphere, and no one pressed her for details. It was clear she wasn’t ready to share more.</p>
            <p>The rest of the day felt unusually quiet, the weight of unspoken emotions hanging in the air. Though the curious glances continued, everyone seemed to understand that some things are better left unsaid—at least for now.</p>
