            <h3>Prologue</h3>
            <p>
                It was a rainy sky of June, but there was no charm or romance to the
                downpour. Instead, the rain fell relentlessly, as if the heavens were shedding
                tears in sync with my own sorrow. The world had become a grey canvas, devoid
                of the joy and vibrancy that should have accompanied the arrival of June.
            </p>
            <p>
                The raindrops fell onto my face as I was lying on the ground. I couldn't move
                an inch towards her. I couldn't help but watch her covered with blood, eyes wide
                opened, shattered glass around her, reflecting her face with tears and blood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Time seemed to stand still as I lay there, the sound of the rain mingling with
                the thumping of my heart. Her face haunted me, etched in agony and despair,
                and my breath caught in my throat. “No, no, this can't be happening,” I
                whispered, the words lost in the pelting rain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every raindrop that touched my skin felt like a cruel reminder of my
                helplessness. I tried to reach out to her, but my body wouldn't respond. The pain
                was numbing, both physical and emotional, and I felt as shattered as the glass
                around us.
            </p>
            <p>
                The scene was like a living nightmare, frozen in time. I could see the faint
                outline of people rushing towards us, their voices a distant murmur. Panic and
                fear were etched on their faces, yet it all felt so far away as if I was trapped in a
                bubble of sorrow, disconnected from the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Her eyes, once so full of life and love, now held a vacant stare. I desperately
                wanted to wipe away the tears and blood from her face, to hold her close. But I
                couldn't move, couldn't even reach out to touch her.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the rain intensified, it mingled with my own tears, blurring the world
                around me even further. It felt as though the rain was weeping for her too,
                mourning the life that had been shattered in an instant.
            </p>
            <p>
                I wanted to scream, to release the overwhelming emotions within me, but my
                voice remained trapped in my throat. All I could do was lie there, watching her,
                feeling the rain and her pain soak into my skin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Gods, I pray to you, each and every one of you. If you're there, please let us
                restart again. I have never once asked you for any favour. But I'm asking now,
                just this one time. Please. I'm begging you. “Please, let us restart again,” I
                muttered.
